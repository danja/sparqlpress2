# SparqlPress2 Development log.

**2021-02-07**

Wordpress does recognise a zip of the SparqlPress files as a plugin. When trying to install, it gives a critical error.

http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/plugin-install.php

Ah, turn on debugging -
```
sudo gedit /opt/lampp/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php

// changed:
// define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
// added:
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', '/home/danny/sparqlpress/wp-errors.log' );

```

**Ooh, useful!!**

To have a look around I did :
```
cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
sudo ln -s ~/sparqlpress/sparqlpress2 sparqlpress
```

http://localhost/phpmyadmin/


**2021-02-06** Just started. Set up this repo.

Rather than attempting to get the previous version working with the 2010 setup, (and risk a mess of redundant packages) I've gone ahead and installed the 2021 target environment (Apache2, MariaDB, WordPress, ARC2 - see [install.md](install.md)).

Docs for the original version are minimal, so I guess I'll start by fumbling around...

I'd already got the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/) installed, so have added ide-php package.
