# SparqlPress2 Development log.

**2021-02-06** Just started. Set up this repo.

Rather than attempting to get the previous version working with the 2010 setup, (and risk a mess of redundant packages) I've gone ahead and installed the 2021 target environment (Apache2, MariaDB, WordPress, ARC2 - see [install.md](install.md)). 

Docs for the original version are minimal, so I guess I'll start by fumbling around...

I'd already got the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/) installed, so have added ide-php package.
