# SparqlPress2
SPARQL tools for Wordpress

Attempting update of [SparqlPress](http://bzr.mfd-consult.dk/sparqlpress/) for [ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2).

**Status** :
Just started. See [devlog.md](devlog.md) for details (environment setup in [install.md](install.md)).

*The goal for SparqlPress is easy-to-use, low-barrier-of-entry, access to the linked data web. There are two, intimately-related sides to the idea: producing data, and consuming it. One goal is to make it easy for Wordpress to expose more data in SPARQL-friendly form. Another is to make it easier to use a Wordpress installation as a personal, perhaps even private, local aggregation of such data.* 

...

*SparqlPress explores the addition of an RDF store to the Wordpress weblogging system through PHP-based extensions, providing a basic Personal Semantic Web Aggregator that can integrate interesting data from nearby in the Web, exposing it to local and remote applications via the SPARQL query language and protocol. The primary goal is to populate the local store with an interesting subset of the nearby Semantic Web, through discovery and crawling of RDF data from the websites (typically blogs; initially Wordpress blogs running the FOAF/SKOS plugin).*

danbri 2021 : "It would be cool to get SparqlPress updated to work with 2021 Wordpress and ARC2 code"
